'''
You take the SAT and score 1100. The mean score for the SAT is 1026 and the standard
deviation is 209. How well did you score on the test compared to the average test taker?
'''

* Mean value for SAT exam (M)= 1026
* Standard Deviation (S)=209
* Sample score (X)=1100

So Z = (X-M)/S = (1100 - 1026)/209 = 0.354

Using left Z table , if we consider Z=0.35, then value is coming as 0.6368 which is 63.68%.

If we consider 50% is average out of 100%, then result is better than average test taker.
